        <h2>History and Domestication</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Malus species are native to the temperate zones of both hemispheres.
            The cultivated apple is thought to have been domesticated from a
            wild apple, M. sieversii, in the Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia
            some <b>4,000 to 10,000 years ago</b>. From there it spread to
            western Europe along the Silk Road and hybridized with a number of
            wild crabapples, including M. baccata from Siberia, M. orientalis
            from the Caucasus, and M. sylvestris, the major secondary genetic
            contributor, from other parts of Europe.

        <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Apple trees are generally small trees, and a given variety can be
            grafted onto dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks for smaller and
            less vigorous plants. If left untrimmed, a tree grown with standard
            rootstock will often reach a height of
            <b>9 metres (30 feet)</b> with an equally large crown diameter. The
            bark is usually brown and scaly.
          </i>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Since the apple requires a considerable period of dormancy, it
            thrives in areas having a distinct winter period, generally from
            latitude <b>30° to 60°</b>, both north and south. Northward, apple
            growing is limited by low winter temperatures and a short growing
            season.
          </i>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Extras</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Scions of desired varieties are commonly grafted onto hardy nursery
            seedlings of about <b>18 months</b> of age; orchard planting follows
            one or two years later. Management during the six to eight years
            before appreciable apple production is reached may consist of little
            more than protection from competing vegetation and pests. Careful
            attention to pruning is required, however, especially during the
            first five years, so that the main scaffold branches will be well
            distributed along the trunk and to prevent development of weak
            crotches, which can break under heavy fruit loads. With mature
            trees, a rigorous spraying regime must be followed to protect
            against insect pests and diseases and possibly to delay spring
            development, to thin young fruit, and to hold the autumn drop of
            ripening fruit to a minimum.
