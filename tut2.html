        >About Apples: apple, (Malus domestica), domesticated tree and fruit of
        the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree
        fruits. Apples are predominantly grown for sale as fresh fruit, though
        apples are also used commercially for vinegar, juice, jelly, applesauce,
        and apple butter and are canned as pie stock. A significant portion of
        the global crop also is used for cider, wine, and brandy. Fresh apples
        are eaten raw or cooked. There are a variety of ways in which cooked
        apples are used; frequently, they are used as a pastry filling, apple
        pie being perhaps the archetypal American dessert. Especially in Europe,
        fried apples characteristically accompany certain dishes of sausage or
        pork. Apples provide vitamins A and C, are high in carbohydrates, and
        are an excellent source of dietary fibre.
