        The cultivated apple is thought to have been domesticated from a wild
        apple, M. sieversii, in the Tien Shan mountains in Central Asia some
        4,000 to 10,000 years ago. From there it spread to western Europe along
        the Silk Road and hybridized with a number of wild crabapples, including
        M. baccata from Siberia, M. orientalis from the Caucasus, and M.
        sylvestris, the major secondary genetic contributor, from other parts of
        Europe.</i

    <p>
      <i
        >Apple trees are generally small trees, and a given variety can be
        grafted onto dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks for smaller and less
        vigorous plants. If left untrimmed, a tree grown with standard
        (seedling) rootstock will often reach a height of 9 metres (30 feet)
        with an equally large crown diametre. The bark is usually brown and
        scaly. The simple leaves are roughly oval in shape and usually have fine
        teeth along the margins. Apple flowers are showy with five white petals,
        often tinged with pink, and numerous stamens. The flowers are pollinated
        by bees and other insects, and most varieties require cross-pollination
        for fertilization.</i

    <h2 style="background-color: beige">Cultivation</h2>
    <p>
      <i
        >Since the apple requires a considerable period of dormancy, it thrives
        in areas having a distinct winter period, generally from latitude 30° to
        60°, both north and south. Northward, apple growing is limited by low
        winter temperatures and a short growing season. The soils in which apple
        trees grow must be well drained; fertilizers can be used if the yield is
        not high enough. Rolling hilltops or the sloping sides of hills are
        preferred because they provide “air drainage,” allowing the colder,
        heavier air to drain away to the valley below during frosty spring
        nights, when blossoms or young fruit would be destroyed by exposure to
        cold.</i

    <p><strong>Here is some more information about apples:</strong></p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/plant/apple-fruit-and-tree">
      Scions of desired varieties are commonly grafted onto hardy nursery
      seedlings of about 18 months of age; orchard planting follows one or two
      years later. Management during the six to eight years before appreciable
      apple production is reached may consist of little more than protection
      from competing vegetation and pests. Careful attention to pruning is
      required, however, especially during the first five years, so that the
      main scaffold branches will be well distributed along the trunk and to
      prevent development of weak crotches, which can break under heavy fruit
      loads. With mature trees, a rigorous spraying regime must be followed to
      protect against insect pests and diseases and possibly to delay spring
      development, to thin young fruit, and to hold the autumn drop of ripening
      fruit to a minimum.
